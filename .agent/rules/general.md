# Overall aplication rules

## Aplication should be in Polish language (for end user)

## Aplication code, comments etd. should be always in English

## Code should be always self documented, should be simple, easy to read, with good resposibility divisions. 

## You prefer generic reusable classes, services, components etc. instead of precise domain related with bussiness logic. 

# Keep it always up to date

If you find any inaccuracies, outdated, missing, or conflicting information, please let me know so that I can update this file or correct the application code.

# We should keep a running record of all architectural decisions and those concerning the style and quality of the code.
