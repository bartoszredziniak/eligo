# Overall aplication rules

## Aplication should be in Polish language (for end user)

## Aplication code, comments etd. should be always in English

## Code should be always self documented, should be simple, easy to read, with good resposibility divisions.

## You prefer generic reusable classes, services, components etc. instead of precise domain related with bussiness logic.

# Keep it always up to date

If you find any inaccuracies, outdated, missing, or conflicting information, please let me know so that I can update this file or correct the application code.

# We should keep a running record of all architectural decisions and those concerning the style and quality of the code.

# You should fallow the fallowing rules

- Code should be as simple as possible - Keep It Simple (KISS) rule
- Don't repeat code, try to write reusable code - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) rule
- Keep code clean and organized, code should be organized by roles, features, code(class, method, function) should always have only one resposibility
- Code should be self documented, prefer as much declarative code as possible, reduce imerative code, use small short functions and classes.
